23. Merge k Sorted Lists

Solution - 
Time Complexity - O(k log n) where k is number of lists present, and n is the number of elements present in k lists
Space Complexity - O(k * n)

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        heap = [] #creating a heap for sorted manner
        for i in lists:
            head = i
            while head: #iterating over each elements present in the lists
                heapq.heappush(heap, head.val)
                head = head.next
        new_head = ListNode(0) #creating a new linked list
        dummy = new_head

        while len(heap) > 0:
            new_head.next = ListNode(heapq.heappop(heap)) #popping it from our heap in sorted manner
            new_head = new_head.next
        
        return dummy.next
