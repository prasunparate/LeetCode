141. Linked List Cycle

Solution - 
Time Complexity - O(n)
Space Complexity - O(1)

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
                              ##using Floyd’s Cycle Detection which is also known as Tortoise and Hare method 
        fast = slow = head

        while fast and fast.next:

            fast = fast.next.next
