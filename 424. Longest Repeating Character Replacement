424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

Solution - 
Time Complexity = O(n)
Space Complexity = O(26) i.e. O(1)
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 0 #window technique
        max_freq = 0 #max valid frequency of current window, which should include k diff elements 
        max_length = 0 #our answer
        alpha = [0] * 26 #to store frequency of characters found 

        while r < len(s):
            alpha[ord(s[r]) - ord('A')] += 1
            max_freq = max(max_freq, alpha[ord(s[r]) - ord('A')])

            if (r-l+1-max_freq) > k:
                alpha[ord(s[l]) - ord('A')] -= 1 #reduce frequency of left character if size is > k
                l+=1

            max_length = max(max_length, r-l+1)
            r+=1
        return max_length
