19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Solution - 
Time Complexity - O(N)
Space Complexity - O(1)

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        #let's create a slow and fast pointer
        slow = head
        fast = head
        #let's move our fast pointer to the n position ahead.
        for i in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
        #a quick check, if fast is None then return head
        if not fast:
            return head.next
        #now since our fast pointer is n position ahead, so let's move our slow pointer and fast pointer, until fast pointer reaches end, so this will result in slow pointer to nth position from the end.
        while fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        #now let's delete the nth node with help of slow pointer
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
