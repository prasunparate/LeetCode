3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Solution -
Time Complexity - O(n)
Space Complexity - O(n)

```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        visited = set()                 #keeping track of characters in current window
        i, j = 0, 0
        res = 0
        while j < len(s):
            if s[j] not in visited:     #checking if its there in current window
                visited.add(s[j])
                j+=1
                res = max(res, j-i)
            else:                       #if yes then remove it from current window
                visited.remove(s[i])
                i+=1
        return res                      #return final result "res"
